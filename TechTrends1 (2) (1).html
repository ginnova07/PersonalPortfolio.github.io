<article id="Digital Identity">
<p class="Header"><b>Digital Identity</p>
<p class="paragraph">Digital Identity is a secure method for sharing personal data on the internet.
it can also be used for computer systems that represent external entities, that include devices, organiztion,
and applications. It also goes into information that is used by computer systems to persent outside entities.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Benifits to Society with this trend are, It has enhanced security and fraud prevention,
reduces identity theft and fraud, it protects sensitive data, and implements a multi-factor authentication.</P>

<article id="VR">
<p class="Header"><b>VR</p>
<p class="paragraph">VR aka Virtual Reality is the use of computer modeling and simulation that allows
a person to interact with an artifact that is three dimensional in an enviornement that is sensory.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Benifits to society with this trend are that VR helps understand complex concepts,
it boost the creativity of the user(s), Vr also helps in the heathcare industry by providing engaging telehealth
experiences, and reduces errors in medical training and increases patient engagement and satisfaction.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Concerns with this trend are that with VR is that you easily get headaches, nausea,
and eyestrains caused when wearing the headset for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Components of technology are required for this Trend are, software, headset, audio system, inout devices, sensors,
Processor.</p>
<p>Careers Related to this Trend are,Virtual Reality Engineer, Visual Systems Designer,VR/AR Capture systems Engineer, 
VR/AR Camera Driver Engineer, VR/AR System Software Engineer,Preformance Engineer. </p>

<article id="Renewable Energy">
<p class="Header"><b>Renewable Energy</p>
<p class="paragraph">Renewable Energy is when someone can use natural energy from the planet like the sun,
 Geothermal, Wind, etc. When creating cars and other devices without causing Carbon Dioxide to go into the plaets
 atmosphere.</p>
<p class="paragraph"> The benifits to society with this trend are that Renewable Energy creates job creation
throughout renewable energy industries. It also allows for abundant, affordable, secure, safe,and clean energy, 
which is beneficial to humans.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Concerns with this trend are that it may generate toxic substances that could
contaminate water resources. Renewable energy installations can also disrupt ecosystems and land use and may use
significant amounts of water.
<p>Components of technology are required for this Trend are, Batteries, Photovoltaic(PV)</p>
<p>Careers Related to this Trend are, Greenhouse worker, Environmental Technician,Urban planner,Solar Installer,
Recycling worker</p>

<article id="Quantum Computing">
<p class="Header"><b>Quantum Computing</p>
<p class="paragraph">Quantum Computing, unlike classical computing, is built on Qubits rather than bits.
While bits can store a value of one or zero, qubits can store both in any combination simultaneously this is called
a "superposition." A single calculation leads to a single path in classical computing, but quantum computing can explore
a massive number.<p>
<p class="paragraph">The benifits to society with this trend are that Quantum computing can solve problems 
significantly faster than classical computers. In 2019, Google had announced that a quantum computer solved a problem
in 200 seconds(about 3 and a half minutes)that would take a normal computer about 10,000 years. The vast number of
solutions it can come up with, It makes it easier to develop models of molecules in the human body,it accelerates
teh training of AI systems, and it can also do prime factorization. This can help Pharmaceutical companies develop
drugs, it also helps the automotive companies teach self-driving cars how to make decisions in crucial moments, and factorize
large prime numbers that buisnesses use as the basis for their encryption efforts.</p>
<p>Careers Related to this Trend are,Quantum Network Security Engineer,Quantum Systems Technician,Quantum Mechanics Developer,
Quantum Hardware/Software Engineer.</p>
</article>

<article id="AI">
<p class="Header"><b>AI</p>
<p class="paragraph">The ability of a computer or robot controlled by a computer to do tasks
usually done by a humans.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The benifits to society with this trend are that AI can do tasks such as data collecting,
data entrym and customer focussed buiness, responeses for emails, software testing, etc, while Employess get time to focus
on tasks that require human abilites.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Concerns with this Trend are that There are many diverse concerbs regarding AI Technology with
ranging from the lack of transparency and privacy to Ethical Dilemmas abd Job displacements.</p>
<p>Components of technology are required for this Trend are,Speech Reconition,Computer Vision,Natural Language processing</p>

</article>

<article id="Cloud Computing">
<p class="Header"><b>Cloud Computing</p>
<p class="paragraph"> Cloud computing to make it short and simple to understand is, its storing and accessing
data and computing services over the internet rather than useing local hard drives and personal data</p>
<p class="paragraph">The benifits to society with this trend is, if using cloud computing gets applications
out to the market quickly</p>
<p class="paragraph"> the concerns/consequences with this trend, is the lack of thereof secure API's. It is easy to access
without authentication, which leads to vulnerability.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Components of technology are required for this Trend are Client Infrastructure, Application, Service
Runtime, Cloud, Storage, Infrastructure, Management, security, and internet.
<p class="paragraph">Some Careers related to this trend are Cloud Administrator, Cloud support engineer,
cloud securtiy analyst, cloud network engineer, cloud softwaer engineer, and cloud automation engineer.
</article>

<article id="Electrical Vehicles">
<p class="Header"><b>Electrical Vehicles</p>
<p class="paragraph">Electrical Vehicle also known as "EV" is a vehicle that can be powered by an electric motor which
brings electricity from a battery and is capable of being charged from an external source.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Some benifits to society with this trend is that using EV's addresses an important public health
hazard. They can also lower vehicle fueling cost by half, or more.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Some concerns/consequences with this trend are that the EV battery production can adversely impact
the enviornement, such as a loss of biodiversity, air pollution and decreased freshwater supply.</p>
